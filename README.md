## Interactivity
- Hover **tooltips** explaining key terms.
- **Accordion** scenarios and breach examples.
- Persistent **compliance checklist** with progress bar (saved to localStorage).
- **Copy-to-clipboard** mini privacy notice and request log templates.

## Publish to GitHub Pages

2. In **Settings → Pages**, set Source to **Deploy from a branch**, Branch: `main`, Folder: `/ (root)`.
3. Your site will be available at `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`.
